Numpy:Numerical Python
It is used to handle the large amount of data quickly with the help of arrays.

#### Creating the array using numpy techniques.

1. np.array(): It is used to create the array.
--> import numpy as np
    arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])
    print(arr)
    
This will create the array not the list.Array is the collection of same type of datatypes while list can include any types of data.Same as list,array is also mutable.


2.np.zeros(): It is used to create the array with only "0" as a element in it.
--> arr=np.zeros(3)
    print(arr)
    This will create the 1D array of three elements as zero in it.The default value is float.
-->output:array([0.,0.,0.])

We can aslo chane the datatype and dimensions of the array to 2D.
--> arr=np.zeros((2,2),dtype=int)
    print(arr)
    This will create the 2D array containing all 0 elements.
-->Output:[[0 0]
           [0 0]]

3.np.ones():It's same as zeros function only difference is it prints 1 instead of 0.
--> arr=np.ones((2,3))
    print(arr)
-->Output:[[ 1 1 1]
           [ 1 1 1]]

4.np.full():It is used to create the array of one constant element. It is also similar to the zeros and ones                     function.
--> arr=np.full((2,2),7)
    print(arr)
-->Output:[[7 7]
           [7 7]]

5.np.arange():It is similar to range function in python. It generates the array from starting value to end-1.
--> arr=np.arange(5)
    print(arr)
-->Output:[0,1,2,3,4]


6.Identity Matrix;np.eye(): It is the matrix having 1 element is its leading diagonal.
--> arr=np.eye(3)
    arr
-->Output: [[1 0 0]
            [0 1 0]
            [ 0 0 1]]
  
*****Non-square Identity Matrix******
--> arr=np.eye(3,4)
    arr
--> Output:[[1 0 0 0]
            [0 1 0 0]
            [0 0 1 0]]

*****Diagonal with K*****
--> arr=np.eye(3,3,k=1) # k=1 means diagonal above the leading diagonal.if k=-1 then diagonal down the leading                             #                         diagonal.
    print(arr)
-->Output:[[0 1 0]
           [0 0 1]
           [0 0 0]]
